    <p>Project Description</p>
    <p>In this project, we attempted to create a computational model for human standing balance that uses physiological signals as inputs (i.e., state) and then act on a physiological environment based on learning outcomes from dopaminergic-like rewards. Human natural postural control relies heavily on rich sensory information from vestibular system, cutaneous receptors, Golgi tendons, joint receptors and muscle spindles. No biological evidence so far has confirmed that the raw sensory information will be converted to abstract variables such as joint angles or center of mass (COM) locations. Therefore, for the state inputs, we used raw afferent data resulting from transfer functions validated in the physiology literature, instead of abstract representation of sensory information (e.g. COM position or ankle jointâ€™s angles). Since there are a variety source of sensory information and multiple muscle groups responsible for balance control, the control of standing balance requires high-dimensional and continuous state-action space. Therefore, the ultimate goal in this project is to build a physiological function approximation method to solve the curse of high dimensionality (i.e., Policy Gradient), honoring physiological characteristics of the brain. For the action space, instead of using torques as an action to the environment, we modeled the action space using muscle activation level that contributes to balance physiologically.
